They say that "necessity is the mother of invention," well this project was based on that axiom. I had an online accounting system that was charging me an arm and a leg to do payroll as well as keep
my books. After a while I grew tired of being gouged by an offshore company for something that my local accountant could easily do, and for *cheaper!* and dealing with obnoxious customer support
people who would put you on hold until their shift was coming to a close, and then send you off to Malaysia! Well, let's just say that I'm not "into it" any more, so I created this project.

## The Project
### Objectives
I needed a way to create employees, customers, contracts, create jobs and associate them to contracts and employees, create invoices and be able to send the invoice to my customers. This project does
that in a very simple and lightweight manner.

### Structure
This project uses [Spring Boot](http://spring.io) as the container and back end to create a [Level 3 Maturity Model](http://martinfowler.com/articles/richardsonMaturityModel.html) using 
[HATEOAS](https://spring.io/understanding/HATEOAS) which displays/edits this information using [AngularJs](https://angularjs.org/) and [angular-spring-data-rest](https://github.com/guylabs/angular-spring-data-rest)
